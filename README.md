# Google-StreetView
Quickly explore the world with this handy widget that opens Google Street View. Instantly access immersive, 360-degree panoramic views of streets, landmarks, and neighborhoods, directly from your ArcGIS Experience Builder app in ArcGIS Enterprise.
# Implementation for Portal
Copy the entire folder into your Enterprise folder where Experience Builder is installed. If a 'custom' folder does not already exist, create one, then paste the folder inside it.
For example:
C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Portal\apps\experiencebuilder\widgets\custom"
